# Display Some Text #

In this section, you will learn how to display simple text with *libGDX*.

## Bitmap fonts ##

*libGDX* can handle only one type of font: **Bitmap Font**.
For those who do not know what it actually is, **Bitmap Font** is a format containing characters in a png file.
As opposed, you can come across the **Outline Font** or **Vector Font**. These fonts are not composed by a pixel array (an image), but simply by using bezier curves and instructions to describe the shape of the glyph. The advantage compared to the **Bitmap Font** is the size, you can scale **Vector Font** as much as you like, as it is not rasterized, you will never see the pixels or an **aliasing effect**. However, it needs more computing to be render and so, they appear to be less efficient than the first type.

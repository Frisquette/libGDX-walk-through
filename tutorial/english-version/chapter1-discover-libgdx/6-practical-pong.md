# Practical Work : (Ping) Pong! #

Welcome to this Practical session, through which you are going to create your first pong! (at least with *libGDX*).

Until now, we did not try to make the game run on **Android** (maybe you did it), because we did not really see how to handle several resolution.

Next chapter will be very detailled regarding multiresolutions, cameras, viewports, etc...

So, for this practical session, we are going to follow these "rules":

* The game will be designed for desktop for learning purposes. All the given images are made to run on a **x** resolution.
* Do not be afraid to modify it as you want, modifying/adding every single features you want.

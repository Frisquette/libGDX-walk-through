# Make Your Game Sound Good #
You will certainly agree with me, but a game without sounds/musics can not be considered as a game...
You are now going to use your hearing.

## Sound Vs Music ##
*libGDX* tries to make the difference between sound and music.
We are going to consider an audio file as a **sound** if it is **concise**, **repeatable** (obviously, it could be both).
For instance, a single gun shot sound, a step noise, etc...

At the opposite, we consider a **long**, repeatable or not audio file as a **music**.

:exclamation: Be aware that if your file is heavy (actually more than **1 mo**), it will be impossible to use

Below a list of supported audio file:

* **ogg**
* **mp3**
* **wav**

## Play your first sound ##

In the asset folder, you have access to several sounds for the tutorial.
We are going to load one, and see how to play it.

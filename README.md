# LearnlibGDXTheRightWay
Welcome in this libGDX tutorial, covering a lot of stuff, from basic to a bit less basic :smiley:

## Requirements ##
In order to follow this course, you will need to know some **basic programming stuff**, especially **object-oriented** knowledge.
As *libGDX* is a Java-based framework, it is better if you know the *Java* programming language. If you don't, take a look at what philosophy it adopts, and try to learn some *Java* specific code before diving in the tutorial.

If you never tried the *Java* language but you have strong knowledge in *C*, *C#*, *C++*, *Python*, etc... the tutorial should be easy to follow.

## libGDX ##

###### What is libGDX :grey_question: ######

*libGDX* is a Java-based cross-platform framework used to facilitate game development.
*libGDX* is based on the *OpenGL* third-party library, used to deal with the **2D** and **3D rendering**.

#### libGDX: Between Pros and... Pros####

###### Some advantages of using libGDX: ######
* Easy to deploy on every supported platforms **(Desktop, Android, iOS, HTML)**
* Efficient framework.
* Easy and quick to write games, as the framework is Java-based. The development will be much simpler than using C++ (some will be happy to use Java, others will cry, the goal here is not to argue whether Java is good or not)

###### Some drawbacks of using libGDX: ######
* Unfortunately, at this time, *libGDX* does not support *Windows Phone 8*. With some patience, it may come one day.
* Generating *HTML* project is quite painful (I found it to).
* As usual, but this is not related to *libGDX* itself, you will need a computer under *MacOS* to deploy on *iPhone/iPad*.

You now understand the section title, *libGDX* has only few cons, and (for me, but maybe not for you) the drawbacks I found do not really bother me.

## Installation ##
###### Here is a list of the necessary tools you need: ######
* Any **Java IDE** you want (actually, an IDE is not really needed, but is recommenced). I would recommend *Intellij IDEA* or *Android Studio*, but it is simply because I used them a lot. The choice of the IDE is subjective, take whatever you are used to use :smiley:
* The **Java JDK**.
* The **Android SDK** if you want your game to run on *Android*.
* The Latest **GWT** version, if you want your game to run in browsers.

The whole installation process (including the download of the above tools) is well describe on the [libGDX page](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29).

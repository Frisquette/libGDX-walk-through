# LearnlibGDXTheRightWay

# Content of the Course #

Welcome in this libGDX tutorial, covering a lot of stuff, from basic to a bit less basic :smiley:

#### What is libGDX :grey_question:####

libGDX is a Java-based cross-platform framework used to facilitate game development.
libGDX is based on the OpenGL third-party library, used to deal with the 2D and 3D rendering.

## libGDX: Between Pros and... Pros##

###### Some advantages of using libGDX: ######
* Easy to deploy on every supported platforms.
* Efficient framework.
* Easy and quick to write games, as the framework is Java-based. The development will be much simpler than using C++ (some will be happy to use Java, others will cry, the goal here is not to argue whether Java is good or not)

###### Some drawbacks of using libGDX: ######
* Unfortunately, at this time, libGDX does not support Windows Phone 8. With some patience, it may come one day.
* Generating HTML project is quite painful (I found it to).
* As usual, but this is not related to libGDX itself, you will need a computer under MacOS to deploy on iPhone/iPad.

You now understand the section title, *libGDX* has only few cons, and (for me, but maybe not for you) the drawbacks I found do not really bother me.

## Installation ##
###### Here is a list of the necessary tools you need: ######
* Any IDE you want (actually, an IDE is not really needed, but is recommenced). I would recommend *Intellij IDEA*, but it is simply because I used it a lot. The choice of the IDE is subjective, take whatever you are used to use :smiley:
* The Java JDK.
* The Android SDK if you want your game to run on Android.
* The Last GWT version, if you want your game to run in browers.

The whole installation process (including the download of the above tools) is well describe on the [libGDX page](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29).
